    <h1>The Book of Dust Volume One: La Belle Sauvage by Philip Pullman</h1>
    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>Volume One of The Book of Dust is named after a canoe but that never actually gets explained
        because Philip Pullman couldn't just take a paragraph to do that. The story is about a weird
        kid who sails about in his sketchy canoe in Britain. He has like three friends his own age and
        spends his time hanging out with nuns and a baby.
